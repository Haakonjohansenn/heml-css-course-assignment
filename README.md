Report: 

We have been given a course assignment, the assignment is to code our design course assignment with html and css. To start off I decided to code for the desktop version, I later realised that this was a mistake and should have started with the smaller design in order to make it responsive. After a little while I decided I had to make the design for mobile first, then use media queries to make sure it was responsive for desktop. My project is a 7 page website, containing a homepage, shop for men/women (decided to only make the men’s shop, because they are more or less the same), a product specific page, a checkout page, checkout success page, an about page and a contact page. 

This report is going to be about my project for the html/css course assignment, I will try to cover my thought process and reasoning behind the decisions I made. 

When starting off my assignment I first looked at my design for desktop version, even though I knew I should have started with the smallest breakpoint. The reason I started with the bigger design was because I started the project early and had already made a few pages for desktop, and I thought it was not going to be a problem… as I got close to finishing my project realised how Important it is to start with the smaller breakpoint, so I decided to go ahead and make the smaller design as well for every page. 

Starting off with my homepage I kept the design pretty much the same, but the background picture, because the picture from my design was a premium picture that I had to pay for. I also changed the header/footer design, my reason being that I was pressured for time and didn’t really understand it… for my next project I will make sure my header and footer is finished early on. I used flexbox for positioning, I also used grid for my buttons to align content within buttons.

For my product page for men, I pretty much copied the design, although I didn’t have time to figure out how to make the “wavy picture”. For this page I also used flexbox. 

My product specific page is almost the same as the design, decided to change the background brightness a little bit. For this page I had to get some assistance for the background, Monde helped me out with this. Flexbox was used for this page as well.
The checkout page I kept the same as the design, I used forms and flexbox. I decided to make an anchor tag for the checkout button instead of an input type submit, to make it interactive without using javascript.

Contact page is pretty much the same as checkout, flexbox and forms, but I left the input type submit, because I didn’t need the button to be interactive.

For the about page, I kept it close to the same as the design, I used flexbox and media queries to make the font-size and picture size bigger and smaller. 

The checkout success page was very simple, an icon and some text and background colour, and of course some flexbox to align everything.

When I ran the site through wave, I discovered my combination of orange background colour and white text colour had to be changed, so I changed them. There were a few errors in my code, like section instead of div etc. decided to correct them. I left a couple of small warnings because I got pressured for time in the end. 

The assignment was fun and VERY educational, I learned a lot during the project, and I had fun while doing it. Sometimes it was very frustrating, but that made it feel so much better when solving the potential issue. However, there are a few things I would do differently the second time. Starting with the smallest breakpoint, finishing the header and footer early, continuously check the code throughout the project for errors… these are some of the things I would do differently. All in all, I am happy with my project in the end, as mentioned I am not 100% satisfied with the end result, but I learned what I can do to change that for my next project.
